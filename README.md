# React Rebuild - Engineering Practices

This project is a deep dive into **React** combined with modern web engineering practices, focusing on **TypeScript (tsx)**, **pnpm**, **ESLint**, **Prettier**, and **Vite**. It was built after revisiting React concepts and applying them to a real-world project for better understanding and performance optimization.

## Project Overview

The **React Rebuild** project serves as a foundation to integrate the latest tools and techniques for building scalable React applications. The aim is to enhance engineering skills in both front-end development and project structure. With a focus on **deep learning** principles, this project emphasizes code quality, maintainability, and performance.

### Key Features
- **React** for building UI components
- **TypeScript (tsx)** for strong typing and developer tooling
- **pnpm** as the package manager for faster and more efficient dependency management
- **Vite** for super-fast development and build processes
- **ESLint** and **Prettier** for maintaining clean, consistent, and error-free code
- Scalable project architecture for future growth and easy collaboration

## Technologies

- **React**: For declarative UI development
- **TypeScript (tsx)**: Adding type safety to JavaScript code
- **pnpm**: Efficient dependency management, improving install times
- **ESLint**: Linting tool to ensure code quality
- **Prettier**: Code formatter to enforce consistent code style
- **Vite**: Lightning-fast build tool to streamline development workflows
